/// Analyzes the current world state and allocates new tasks to agents.
///
/// This function represents the "brains" of the mission planning. It is responsible
/// for deciding what agents should do next based on the overall mission objectives
/// and the current state of the simulation.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `_state` - A read-only reference to the `CanonicalState` of the simulation.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// A `HashMap` where the key is the `agent_id` and the value is the `Task`
/// assigned to that agent. Agents not present in the map are not assigned a new task.
///
/// # Implementation Note
///
/// As per the project specification, this is a placeholder implementation. The focus
/// is on the architecture that enables tasking, not the complexity of the tasking
/// algorithm itself. Future work could involve implementing algorithms such as:
///
/// - Frontier-based exploration (finding the edges of the known map).
/// - Greedy allocation (assigning agents to the nearest unexplored area).
/// - Coverage planning algorithms.
/// - Dynamic tasking based on operator commands.
